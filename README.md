### 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** with professional experience since **2016**, passionate about building modern, scalable, and user-centric web applications.

💡 I started my journey working with **Vue.js, Nuxt.js, and MySQL**, and evolved to specialize in a powerful stack based on:

- **Frontend:** React.js · Next.js · Tailwind CSS · TypeScript
- **Backend:** Node.js · Express.js · MongoDB · Serverless
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS (S3, EC2, DynamoDB, SQS) · Vercel · Netlify
- **Productivity Tools:** Cursor (AI), Visual Studio Code, GitHub, Jira, Slack, Postman, Notion

I’m especially interested in **AI-augmented development workflows** — using tools like **Cursor** to boost productivity, improve code quality, and ship faster.

### 🌱 What I'm Working On

- Enhancing **user experience** and **performance** through better architecture and design.
- Driving key features that impact **engagement**, **retention**, and **metrics**.
- Building tools and practices that scale in fast-paced, product-driven teams.
