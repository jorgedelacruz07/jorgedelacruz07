### Hi ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer with more than 5 years of experience. I have experience with Javascript (and Typescript), Node.js and React.js. Iâ€™ve worked with Express.js, Koa.js and Serverless as Node.js frameworks. I built a lot of websites with Next.js and others with Nuxt.js. Also Iâ€™ve worked with AWS products as DynamoDB, SQS, EC2 and S3. In my first years of work, I worked with PHP (Laravel framework) and Vue.js. I like to work with Visual Code Studio, GitHub, Jira, Postman, Slack to help me to work better.
